# BloodioWorks
iOS app for BloodWorks organization's fundraiser, plays audio files for guests

## Known Issues:
App plays fine on simulator, but on actual device, it will only play sound through headphones or bluetooth speaker. 
Confirmed in entirely separate builds. May be an issue with AVFoundation library?
